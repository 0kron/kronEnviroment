# Recommended extensions: 

## It is preferred to add the Gnome Extensions plug-in to Firefox previously.

- ArcMenu: Bar and applications menu, KDE like. 
- Background Logo: 
- Blur my Shell: Eliminate the black parts of Gnome 40. 
- Dash to panel. 
- Tray Icons: Reloaded - makes the use of second plane applications easier. 
- Vitals: Show the state of the computer.


# Recommmended themes: 

- All the Juno themes are elegant and work perfectly with Gnome 40. 
- Flat-Remix: simple but effective unicolor themes. 
- Nordic: as always one of the best options. 

# Recommended icons: 
- Flatery: depends on the overall style, but are always a save choice. 
- Candy-Icons: too gamer, and too good. 
- Sensual-Breeze-Dark: Elegant and simple. 
- Yaru-Purple: Personally my favorite Yaru color.
