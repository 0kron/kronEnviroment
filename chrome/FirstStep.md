# FirefoxCSS Customization: 

## GNU/Linux Steps:

1. Firstly enable the **chrome** folder use on Firefox. 
  Go to: [about:config]("about:config") on Firefox and set to `true`the `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets`.

2. Then go into the `.mozilla/firefox/XXXXX.default-release`the XXXXX stand for any random name the firefox installation had given to it. 

3. In that folder, `cp` the chrome folder of this repository. 


## Windows 10: 
1. Go to [about:support]("about:support") and look for the **Profile Director**, and open the directory, there you will copy the files in this repository. 

2. Now enable **chrome** folder use on Firefox. 
  Go to: about:config["about:config"] on Firefox and set to `true`the `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets`.
  
3. Copy the files and edit them at will. There are useful comments, feel welcome to ask in any capacity. 

**Note:** The customization is pretty minimal, for something crazier edits check out: [r/FirefoxCSS]("https://www.reddit.com/r/FirefoxCSS/")
